# Overview

Library of functions for polynomial arithmetic and computing integral Gröbner basies, incuding Gröbner basis of the intersections of two ideals and the Gröbner basis of Syzygys. In addtion, the polynomials used to provide any Gröbner basis interms of the orginal ideal genraotrs can be tracked and returned. If ideal generators are homogenious polynomials, then computations can be restricted to a maximal degree (or dgrees within a partiton of the varaibles).

The code accompanies the paper: Matthew Burfitt, Jelena Grbic "The cohomology of free loop spaces of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=SU(n %2B 1)/T^n">" and the libray includes everything needed to be applied to computations with certian Leray-Serre spectral sequences. All code providing computational results presented in the paper are given as exaples.

# Installation

Place a copy of "IntagralGrobner.py" in your python path, nothing else required other than Python 3.

# Usage

Load the *IntagralGrobner* libray.

```python
import IntagralGrobner as G
```

## Example

Terms are represented as a list of lenght two the fist entry is the scaler constant (an integer) and the second a lsit (of integer) poweres of varaibles in the term.
A *polynomial* is a list of terms with the same number of varaibles.
We represent the polynomial <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2 %2B 2xy - 3y^2"> as followes.

```python
#define a polynomila x^2+2xy-3y^2
polynomial = [ [1, [2,0]], [2, [1,1]], [-3, [0,2]] ]

#display the polynomial
print(G.poly_to_text(polynomial, ['x', 'y']))
```

Basic polynomial operations such as evaluation, negation, addtion and multiplication can be applied to polynomials.

```python
#define a list of symetric polynomials
polys=[
      [ [1, [2,0,0]], [1, [0,2,0]], [1, [0,0,2]], [1, [1,1,0]], [1, [1,0,1]], [1, [0,1,1]] ],
      [ [1, [1,0,0]], [1, [0,1,0]], [1, [0,0,1]] ],
      [ [1, [3,0,0]], [1, [0,3,0]], [1, [0,0,3]], [1, [2,1,0]], [1, [2,0,1]], [1, [1,2,0]], [1, [0,2,1]], [1, [1,0,2]], [1, [0,1,2]], [1, [1,1,1]] ]
      ]
 
#display the polynomial list
G.display_poly_list(polys, ['x', 'y', 'z'])

#sort polynomials by lexicographical ordering on varaibles and enumerated list disaplay
sorted_poly = G.sort_poly(polys[0])
print(G.poly_to_text(sorted_poly, ['x', 'y', 'z']))
sorted_polys = G.sort_poly_list(polys)
G.display_poly_list_numbered(sorted_polys, ['x', 'y', 'z'])

#evaluate or partialy evaluate a polynomial on variables
fully_evaluated_poly = G.eval_poly(polys[0], [1,2,3])
print(fully_evaluated_poly)
partialy_evaluated_poly1 = G.eval_poly(polys[0], [0,None,None])
print(G.poly_to_text(partialy_evaluated_poly1, ['y', 'z']))
partialy_evaluated_poly2 = G.eval_poly(polys[0], [0,None,None], keep_varaible_positions = True)
print(G.poly_to_text(partialy_evaluated_poly2, ['x', 'y', 'z']))

#polynomial arithmetic
new_poly = G.add_poly(G.mult_poly(polys[1], polys[1]), G.neg_poly(polys[0]))
print(G.poly_to_text(new_poly, ['x', 'y', 'z']))
x = [[2, [1,0,0]]]
new_poly_list = G.mult_list(x, polys)
G.display_poly_list_numbered(new_poly_list, ['x', 'y', 'z'])
```

For the purpose of Gröbner basis computations, we treat a list of polynomials as the gnerators of an ideal.
